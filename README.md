# homework-helper Product Documentation

## Project Blurb

The Homework Helper program aims to promote peer to peer collaboration in understanding and/or further clarifing specific homework related questions outside instruction hours. There are many approaches to assignments and when you become stuck solving a question, an outside perspective can make the difference and Home Helper will be offering just that, outside persepectives.
